# TODO
- [ ] Aligning the depth, RGB, and skeleton image streams both in terms of resolution as well as distance
- [ ] Adding the stop and start button so that after every 3 repetition of each exercise we can stop the capture
- [ ] Looking into more organized format for folder rather than Download folder such as "Person1-Ex2-Date"
- [ ] Visualizing the Skeleton data on the RGB data because the Skeleton information shown on the Web screen is not very exact.
